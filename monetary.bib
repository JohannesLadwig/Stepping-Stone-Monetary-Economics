The model economy is used to analyze whether the business cycle is different in high inflation and low inflation economies and to analyze the impact of variability in the growth rate of money. In addition, the welfare cost of the inflation tax is measured and the steady-state properties of high and low inflation economies are compared.},

When analysing the full sample of countries, we find a strong positive relation between long-run inflation and the money growth rate. The relation is not proportional, however. The strong link between inflation and money growth is almost wholly due to the presence of high- (or hyper-) inflation countries in the sample. The relationship between inflation and money growth for low-inflation countries (on average less than 10% per annum over the last 30 years) is weak.},

  ignore_abstract = {The introduction and widespread use of credit cards increases trading efficiency but, by also increasing the velocity of money, it causes inflation, in the absence of monetary intervention. If the monetary authority attempts to restore pre-credit card price levels by reducing the money supply, it might have to sacrifice the efficiency gains. When there is default on credit cards, there is even more inflation, and less efficiency gains. The monetary authority might then have to accept less than pre-credit card efficiency in order to restore pre-credit card price levels, or else it will have to accept inflation if it is unwilling to cut efficiency below pre-credit card levels. This could be a source of stagflation.},
